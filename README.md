# R Shinyapp for demonstrating CLT

Few months ago, I gave a presentation on R Shiny Apps to an FPM (PhDs) class. Although the session was quite brief in itself, we developed a small central limit theorem demonstrator. Its not feature rich or anything -- just serves the purpose of "seeing" central limit theorem.
